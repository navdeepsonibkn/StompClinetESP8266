# StompClient
A STOMP client library for use with Arduino ESP8266 and Websockets

# Description
Small library to allow devices which can run the Websockets library (https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets.git) to 
connect to a STOMP broker, either directly or using SockJS wrapper.

# Examples
There are two example sketches included, which should be used together.

The examples have been tested using the https://github.com/dmcintyre-pivotal/ESPStompExample application, which is a simple Stomp server implemented using Spring Boot.
